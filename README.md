Python Control Structures Assignment
This repository contains two Python scripts demonstrating fundamental control structures: if-else statements and for loops.

Task 1: Even or Odd Number Checker
This script prompts the user for an integer and uses an if-else statement to determine if it's even or odd.

Task 2: Sum of 1 to 50
This script calculates the sum of integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop.
